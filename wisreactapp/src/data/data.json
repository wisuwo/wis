  "About": {
    "paragraph": "Women in Science (WiS) at Western University is a student-led organization dedicated to fostering a vibrant community of friendship, leadership and mentorship, while showcasing talented women in the Faculty of Science. Research has proven the invaluable impact of mentorship on female scientists, so we aim to connect young women with mentors established in their fields through the Little Sisters in Science and Sisters in Science mentorship programs. We support the inclusivity and continued contributions of women in science, while encouraging male participation in stereotypical “feminine” fields, and promoting gender non-conforming people in all scientific endeavours.",
    "Why": [
      "Identify: We seek to identify and eliminate the sources of gender disparity in the STEM fields",
      "Connection: We aim to connect young women with peers and mentors to help them pursue their dream careers in STEM"
    ],
    "Why2": [
      "Inclusivity: We aim to encourage inclusivity and continued contributions of women in science, starting on campus", 
      "Community: We aim to build community through academic and social events, while providing a safe, welcoming environment"
